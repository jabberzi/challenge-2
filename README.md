# <Challenge-2>

## Description

A portfolio page displaying my photo, contact information, and applications that I have made. A portfolio is important for people, including potential employers, to view my recent work. This website displays all relevant information in a clean and aesthetically pleasing manner. Building the site helped me to better understand the box model and flexbox functions.
